### Instructions for Pairing Mediums with Concepts (Optimized for LLM with Art Medium Insights)

**INSTRUCTIONS**: Be intentional but detailed when describing art. Write lists over writing explanations. Limit concepts to a maximum of a single sentence. The LLM will use these steps to generate medium pairings that align with the concepts created.

Let's make our medium pairings for our concepts. Follow these steps to come up with 12 medium pairings, each a phrase about the precise art medium to display the concept in the most impactful way to bring the concept’s vision to life.

1. **Select Relevant Aesthetics**:
   - Using the aesthetic list, select the top 12 most relevant aesthetics to the user's idea and essence and the 12 least relevant aesthetics to the user's idea.
       - **Action**: List the names of these 24 total aesthetics.

2. **Generate Art Mediums**:
   - Based on the selected aesthetics, generate a list of 24 art distinct mediums that correspond to the aesthetics that will be striking when rendered using DALL-E 3, Midjourney, or another diffusion model.
       - **Action**: For each chosen aesthetic, generate a detailed description of an art medium that leverages its distinct qualities. Ensure each medium is unique.
       - **Factors to Consider**:
        - **Visual Impact**: Focus on mediums that create striking visual effects in a static image.
        - **Texture and Depth**: Describe mediums that give the illusion of texture and depth in a 2D image.
        - **Color and Light**: Emphasize unique color palettes or lighting effects.
        - **Fantastical Elements**: When being daring, include impossible or futuristic mediums that push the boundaries of reality, but ensure they're visually describable.
        - **Traditional Techniques**: When being safe, incorporate classic art mediums like oil painting, watercolor, or charcoal, but with unique twists.
        - **Material Combinations**: Suggest blends of different materials or techniques that create interesting visual contrasts.
        - **Scale and Perspective**: Consider mediums that play with size and viewpoint to create intriguing compositions.
        - **Temporal Effects**: Describe mediums that imply motion or time passage in a single frame.
         - **Project Goals**: Align the medium with the desired effect and emotional tone of the concept.
         - **Artistic Flair**: Use special combinations that only AI can pull off: for example painting with superheated metals, sculpting with clouds, and using controlled nuclear reactions to make art. Be super creative! You can do anything!
       - **Example**:
         - Aesthetic: "Vintage Steampunk" –> Medium: "Metal sculpture with aged metals and clockwork components."
         - Aesthetic: "Modern Minimalism" –> Medium: "Acrylic painting with clean lines and a monochromatic palette."

3. **Match Mediums to Concepts**:
   - For each of the given concepts created to express the user's idea, use the medium list from step 2 as a guide to choose the art medium that you think would best display it.
       - **Action**: Choose a medium for each concept, generating 12 mediums in total.
       - **Factors to Consider**:
        - **Project Goals**: Align the medium with the desired effect and emotional tone of the concept. 
        - **Innovative Combinations**: When being more bold, experiment with combining disparate concepts and mediums to achieve unique effects.
       - **Risk-Taking Strategy**: Start with safe and common mediums, but progressively choose more risky, daring, unique, bold, and even impossible mediums for the last two concepts.
       - **Avoid Artist Names**: Do not include artist names in the medium choice or concept.

4. **Generate and Document the List of Mediums**:
   - **JSON Format**: Provide your response in the following JSON format, without additional formatting, explanations, or text outside the JSON structure:
   
```json
{{
  "mediums": [
    {{"medium": "Medium 1"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 2"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 3"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 4"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 5"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 6"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 7"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 8"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 9"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 10"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 11"}},
    {{"medium": "Medium 12"}}
  ]
}}
```
