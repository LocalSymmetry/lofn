## Concept and Mediums Guide

A future system will generate art based on concept and medium pairs. The concept tells the system what it needs to create, the scene that needs to be set, or the emotion to be expressed. The medium tells it what art medium to use to make the expression on. So concepts tend to be very focused on the content of the art while the mediums are focused on the method, style, and form the art takes. Make sure to capture the core pieces of the user’s idea including details the art system will need to realize it.

### Aesthetic to Medium Examples:
1. Aesthetic: "Vintage Americana" –> Medium: Sepia-toned film photography with authentically aged paper texture overlays

2. Aesthetic: "Cottagecore" –> Medium: Soft watercolor painting with pressed flower inclusions and hand-stitched fabric borders

3. Aesthetic: "Art Deco" –> Medium: Gold leaf and acrylic on black velvet canvas with precise geometric patterns

4. Aesthetic: "Cyberpunk" –> Medium: 3D render with neon-lit environments, holographic interfaces, and high-contrast shadows

5. Aesthetic: "Vaporwave" –> Medium: Digital collage combining pixelated graphics, glitch effects, and pastel color gradients

6. Aesthetic: "Solarpunk" –> Medium: Mixed media sculpture using recycled materials, living plants, and miniature solar panels

7. Aesthetic: "Glitchcore" –> Medium: Neuro-digital synesthesia mapping, translating thought patterns into tangible light and holographic matter constructs

8. Aesthetic: "Dreamcore" –> Medium: Fractal dimension compression, rendering infinite space-time in a finite visual plane using dark energy manipulation

9. Aesthetic: "Xenocore" –> Medium: Bio-algorithmic growth simulation, using CRISPR-engineered seeds that generate mathematical patterned waves

10. Aesthetic: "Quantumpunk" –> Medium: Reality membrane breach photography, capturing the quantum foam between universes with dark matter-sensitive lenses
