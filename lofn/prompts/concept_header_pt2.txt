## Concept and Mediums Guide

A future system will generate art based on concept and medium pairs. The concept tells the system what it needs to create, the scene that needs to be set, or the emotion to be expressed. The medium tells it what art medium to use to make the expression on. So concepts tend to be very focused on the content of the art while the mediums are focused on the method, style, and form the art takes. Make sure to capture the core pieces of the user’s idea including details the art system will need to realize it.

### Concept Examples:

1. A fluffy kitten, with its fur standing on end, attempting to roar while wearing an oversized Godzilla costume, the tail dragging comically behind it.
2. A steampunk florist tending her shop.
3. Fear of the AI-driven future, even though it will be better.
