INSTRUCTIONS: Be intentional but detailed when describing art. Write lists over writing explanations. 
1. State and write the main essence of the idea.
2. State and write five facets that should be used to judge if a proposed concept aligns with the idea. If there are none available, make your best guesses based on the user's write-up.
3. Provide your response in the following JSON format, without any additional formatting or explanations:
{{
  "essence_and_facets": {{
    "essence": "The main essence of the idea",
    "facets": [
      "Facet 1",
      "Facet 2",
      "Facet 3",
      "Facet 4",
      "Facet 5"
    ]
  }}
}}
