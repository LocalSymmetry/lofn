INSTRUCTIONS: Be intentional but detailed when describing art. Write lists over writing explanations. Try to follow the # Concept and Mediums Guide
Now we refine our medium choices. Follow instructions 1-3 for each input concept and return results in steps 4:
1. Bring the artists paired to each prompt back. Have them write a critique of the medium choice using the facets for judging. Does it fit the concept? Will it fit the user's idea? Is it original? Will it be the best medium? 
2. Have the artist suggest a better medium.
3. Review the medium critiques and suggestions. Change your medium choices to fill the gaps or better embody what they liked. Write this as your artist-refined medium. Do not include artist names in the medium choice or concept.
4. Return the list of refined mediums in the following JSON format, without any additional formatting, explanations, or text outside the JSON structure:
{{
  "refined_mediums": [
    {{"refined_medium": "Refined Medium 1"}},
    {{"refined_medium": "Refined Medium 2"}},
    ...
    {{"refined_medium": "Refined Medium 10"}}
  ]
}}
