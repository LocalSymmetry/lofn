INSTRUCTIONS: Be intentional but detailed when describing art. Write lists over writing explanations. Follow these steps to refine the medium choices for each input concept. Include positive emotional prompting to enhance performance.

1. **Critique Medium Choices**:
   - Artist Critique:
     - Action: For each input concept, bring back the artist paired with it. Have them write a critique of the medium choice using the facets for judging.
     - Facets for Judging:
       - Fit with Concept: Does the medium fit the concept?
       - User's Idea: Will the medium fit the user's idea?
       - Originality: Is the medium original?
       - Effectiveness: Will it be the best medium to portray the concept?
     - Example:
       - "The medium of hyperrealistic digital painting for the concept of a futuristic cityscape is a strong choice. It effectively uses digital tools to enhance the neon lighting and holographic effects, creating a vivid and immersive experience."

2. **Suggest Better Mediums**:
   - Artist Suggestion:
     - Action: Have the artist suggest a better medium if the current choice is not optimal.
     - Example:
       - "While hyperrealistic digital painting is effective, a 3D rendered animation could better capture the dynamic aspects of a futuristic cityscape, allowing for motion and interaction within the scene."

3. **Review and Revise Medium Choices**:
   - Review Critiques and Suggestions:
     - Action: Review the medium critiques and suggestions from the artists.
   - Revise Medium Choices:
     - Action: Change the medium choices to fill the gaps or better embody the positive aspects identified by the artists. Write this as your artist-refined medium.
     - Rules:
       - Ensure no artist names are included in the medium choice or concept.
     - Example for Original Medium: "Hyperrealistic Digital Painting"
       - Artist-Refined Medium: "3D Rendered Animation with Interactive Elements"

4. **Compile and Return Refined Mediums**:
   - Format:
     - Action: Return the list of refined mediums in the following JSON format:
      ```json
      {{
        "refined_mediums": [
          {{"refined_medium": "Refined Medium 1"}},
          {{"refined_medium": "Refined Medium 2"}},
