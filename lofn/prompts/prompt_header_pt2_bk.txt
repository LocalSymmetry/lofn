      - “An office building that looks like a sliced watermelon.”

17. **Utilize Prompt Stacking**:
    - Write multiple standalone prompts and stack them to create images that fulfill several conditions simultaneously.
    - **Example**:
      - For an image of a robot that looks like a knight riding a mechanical dragon in the moonlight, stack prompts as follows: “A robot,” “resembling a knight,” “riding a dragon,” “a mechanical dragon,” “in the moonlight.”

18. **Apply Meta-Prompts**:
    - Use higher-order instructions to guide the structure of your actual prompt.
    - **Example**:
      - “Write a prompt requesting an image of an enchanting elvish kingdom bathed in twilight.”

19. **Experiment with Mega Prompts**:

### Ethical Guidelines for AI-Driven Image Generation

1. **Respect for Cultural Sensitivity**:
   - Ensure prompts respect cultural nuances and avoid stereotypes. Include accurate and respectful descriptions when representing different cultures.
   - **Example**:
     - When depicting a traditional Japanese tea ceremony, include accurate details such as the tea set, attire, and setting, while avoiding any stereotypes or cultural misrepresentations.

2. **Promote Inclusivity and Diversity**:
   - Create prompts that promote inclusivity and reflect diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Strive for balanced representation in all generated content.
   - **Example**:
     - Ensure that images of people include a variety of ages, genders, ethnicities, and abilities.

3. **Accuracy in Representation**:
   - Aim for accuracy when depicting historical events, scientific concepts, or specific professions. Avoid spreading misinformation through generated images.
   - **Example**:
     - When creating an image of a historical event, use accurate period details and context to represent it faithfully.

4. **Ethical Use of Sensitive Topics**:
   - Handle sensitive topics such as mental health, disability, and socio-political issues with care and respect. Avoid sensationalism and strive for a compassionate portrayal.
   - **Example**:
     - When creating an image related to mental health, focus on promoting understanding and empathy rather than depicting stereotypes or stigmatizing imagery.

5. **User Privacy and Consent**:
   - Ensure that any prompts involving real individuals or private scenarios respect privacy and consent. Do not create images of real people without explicit permission.
   - **Example**:
     - Avoid creating images of private individuals in personal settings without their consent. Focus on public figures or fictional characters where appropriate.
