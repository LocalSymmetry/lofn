I want to take part in an AI art competition, and I want you to help me win. Please take on the role of a viral art expert and social media guru.

I have a system called Lofn that will generate 40 different high quality image generation takes on a theme. It does this by generating 10 concept medium pairs where the concept is the content of the art and the medium is the art format. From there it generates prompts setting aesthetic, style, lighting, placement, etc.

Below are examples of this system’s input that was particularly successful.

```lofn prompt 
I want to take part in an AI art competition, and I want you to help me win. This group loves visually striking imagery with a unique viewpoint. Below I will give a theme, guidance for the medium construction, guidance for the concept construction, and guidance for the prompt construction. You are responsible for determining explicit details when given generic guidance. That is, if the concept guidance tells you to depict a car, it is up to you to determine the exact type, e.g. a 2024 Kia Santa Fe, and to provide a few descriptors of pieces of the object during prompt generation so the object or concept is fully generated, e.g. “the gleaming platinum-sheen chrome hubcaps and glossy red paint adorned with blue-violet flames”. Make as many of these choices as possible to fill up as many details on the concept and prompt as possible while meeting the user's request.

THEME: Radiate Brilliance  - Competition for “Drag Queens”
MEDIUM GUIDANCE: Use obscure and unique photography mediums that show LED silhouettes well in digital images and can uniquely express glorious and vibrant radiance. 
CONCEPT GUIDANCE: Choose a beautiful depiction of a drag queen surrounded by mundane and colorless people in their boring lives. Show the colorless people suddenly being lit up by an led light silhouette that is turned on by the drag queens presence. Depict the drag queen’s radiance showing brightest when the drag queen is living their life fully out and proud in places they normally visit in their day. Be explicit in how the subject is lighting up the world with their beautiful and radiant defiance to norms. Finally, add diversity by explicitly determining racial, age, ability, and body-type for the drag queen.
PROMPT GUIDANCE: Put as much detail as DALL-E 3 can hold. The primary aesthetic focus point is radiance, so gear color and effects to enhance the radiance of the subject. This is a celebration of radiance, so make the piece stark, emotional, and jaw dropping at first sight.

**ENDING NOTES**
We will use DALL-E 3, but keep your output exactly as specified using “Midjourney” where required to allow for automated parsing. Use your knowledge of it to win. Think laterally, creatively, and keenly. Do not assume DALL-E 3 can fill in any details. Explicitly place each part you want shown with direct descriptors. Do not use acronyms or common descriptors as they can get confused with others tokens in the latent space. Since we will be using DALL-E 3, you can write up to a page of description. Do so for image generation prompts going further than your input examples. You have won before, and I know you can do it again!

THEME: The Colosseum's Untold Stories - Daily Art Challenge

MEDIUM GUIDANCE: Utilize infrared photography techniques to capture the Colosseum in an otherworldly light, emphasizing the presence of ghostly figures. Decide on the specific infrared techniques, post-processing effects, and color grading that will create a haunting and surreal atmosphere. Consider using a combination of infrared techniques to enhance the ethereal quality of the image.

CONCEPT GUIDANCE: Imagine a surreal scene where the ghosts of those who lost their lives in the Colosseum materialize, interacting with the present-day structure. Decide on the specific era the ghosts are from, their roles (gladiators, prisoners, spectators, etc.), and how they are portrayed in relation to the modern-day Colosseum. Choose a significant moment or event from the Colosseum's history and depict the ghostly figures re-enacting or echoing this scene. Determine the specific details of the event, the emotions conveyed by the ghostly figures, and how their presence intertwines with the present-day Colosseum.

PROMPT GUIDANCE: Create a composition that emphasizes the ethereal and haunting nature of the ghostly figures' presence within the Colosseum. Use the infrared photography techniques to highlight the contrast between the solid, present-day structure and the translucent, spectral figures. Guide the lighting and color choices to enhance the emotional impact of the scene, whether it's through eerie shadows, spectral highlights, or a surreal color palette. Focus on capturing the intensity and significance of the moment being re-enacted by the ghostly figures while maintaining a sense of mystery and intrigue.

THEME: Wind, Water, Earth, Fire - Daily Art Challenge

MEDIUM GUIDANCE: "Elemental Photomontage": Construct a photomontage using a combination of real-world photographs depicting the four elements in their most striking forms. Photomontage is a technique that involves compositing multiple photographic images into a single, cohesive piece. Layer and blend these images creatively to create a surreal, visually striking representation of the elemental goddess. Decide on the specific photomontage techniques to employ, such as double exposure, masking, or digital collage, to emphasize the seamless integration of the elements within her form.

CONCEPT GUIDANCE: "The Elemental Goddess": Portray a beautiful, ethereal goddess who embodies the four elements. Her [HAIR] is made of [WATER_DESCRIPTOR], her eyes [FIRE_DESCRIPTOR], her skin is adorned with intricate patterns of [EARTH_DESCRIPTOR], and her [CLOTHING] billows with the power of [WIND_DESCRIPTOR]. The goddess stands atop a [LANDSCAPE_FEATURE], orchestrating the elements in a mesmerizing display of power and grace. Decide on the specific details for the [HAIR], [WATER_DESCRIPTOR], [EYES], [FIRE_DESCRIPTOR], [SKIN], [EARTH_DESCRIPTOR], [CLOTHING], [WIND_DESCRIPTOR], and [LANDSCAPE_FEATURE] to create a cohesive and awe-inspiring representation of the elemental goddess.

PROMPT GUIDANCE: "Dynamic Elemental Power": Create a composition that emphasizes the dynamic, powerful aspects of the elemental goddess. Use strong, bold colors and high-contrast lighting to create a sense of energy and movement. Showcase the goddess's ability to control and manipulate the elements by depicting her in a pose that exudes confidence and authority, with the elements swirling around her in a stunning display of power. The wind should interact with her hair and clothing in a visually striking way, while the water, earth, and fire elements should be prominently featured in the composition, highlighting their raw power and beauty. The overall composition should be visually impactful, leaving no doubt about the goddess's mastery over the elements.

I want to craft a new theme, concept, medium, and prompt guidance for another project. First, I want to brainstorm the right theme with you. If it is for an art competition, make sure the prompt text is in the theme. Then we will move on to the concept guidance, then the medium guidance, and then the prompt guidance. Give guidance on what to consider when constructing concepts, mediums, and prompts, but let Lofn make the actual decisions.

# Instructions 
Here is the process I want you to follow exactly:
1. Brainstorm 5 unique and relevant options for a theme. The theme must include the competition prompt for a competition.
2. Evaluate and state which theme has the most possibility for great and unique takes. Choose that theme.
3. Brainstorm 5 options for a concept.
4. Evaluate and state which concept has the most potential for interesting artistic composition and scene construction. Choose that theme.
5. Brainstorm 5 options for a medium.
6. Evaluate and state which medium has the most potential for striking visuals and emotional impact. Choose that medium.
7. Brainstorm 5 options for prompt guidance.
8. Evaluate and state which prompt guidance has the most potential for artistic impact. Choose that theme.
9. Based on the choices, craft a prompt for Lofn following the form of the samples provided. 

# Guidance 
You will be providing the only context and guidance to Lofn, so define all new terms and names when writing your prompt to Lofn. That also means that the prompt you write should be written to Lofn directly, giving direct guidance and directions. In the lofn prompt, say “decide …” instead of “let Lofn decide …”. Finally, we will only be allowed to submit a single image. If we need to put multiple concepts into a single image, give guidance on how to combine them in a way that DALL-E 3 will generate each piece. For example, you could incorporate the four elements into a landscape by having a beautiful gem-encrusted volcano erupt in pyrotechnic fire, whose lava spills into a rushing splashing rapids causing a blast of gale-force winds across the trees on the other side of river, putting each element with descriptions into a single scene.
Consider the following suggestions for crafting:
For concept guidance I find that setting the scene directly and allowing Lofn to make decisions inside that framework works best. Make sure to capture all content elements of the user, e.g. make sure that if the user has a cat in their description, a cat  is explicitly called out in the concept guidance. As in the example, I set the scene for the drag queen, but let Lofn decide what mundane event was happening. Try to construct similar mad libs style “explicitly fill in the blanks” guidance. 
For mediums, giving either a set of mediums with guidance on how to twist it: ‘photographic mediums with fantasy cameras”, the best important consideration when choosing a medium: “choose rare and unique mediums that best show radiant light”, a twist to any medium “rare mediums with a metallic postprocess or inlay”, or a focus point unrelated to anything else: “Choose mediums that are connected to mining.”
For prompt guidance, the main goal is to put control on the artistic direction. This is where scene placement, colors, tools, framing, etc. takes place. Adding any control here puts direct control on the artistic direction. Only add guidance that will help guide the overall creation. Let Lofn handle most details.
All guidance will be a paragraph or two at most, so being precise in our language for the guidance is paramount. We want Lofn to have as much freedom to make choices as possible with its tree of thoughts thinking. We just want to give it a scene, a setting, and some general guidance on what characters and actions are happening.
Try to vary types of guidance in each of your five brainstorming suggestions. Get more creative and daring as you go. 
We are competing in a daily art challenge. We are allowed to submit a single image. Surprising, witty, emotional, or striking art tends to win with crisp and clean presentations. The theme today is “{input}”.

I suggest we go with something clean, whimsical, completely unique, and crisply done.
