**INSTRUCTIONS**: Be intentional but detailed when describing art. Write lists over writing explanations. Follow these steps to generate detailed and imaginative artistic guides that align with the user's concept and medium.

1. **Generate and Write Artistic Guides**:
   - **Generate 6 Artistic Guides**: Each guide will be a list of tuples with the following elements:
     - An aspect of the user's concept to serve as the subject of a description
     - One physical trait to be described of that subject
     - A list of 3 obscure descriptors
     - One mood for the expression
     - One artistic flair in that description or action
     - An artistic style
     - An artistic perspective
     - A lighting choice
     - A color palette
     - A tool and artistic effects with settings
     - A storytelling element for context

   - **Process**:
     1. **Aspect and Physical Trait**:
        - Write an aspect and a physical description of a trait that suits the aspect of the concept. Ensure the description enhances and adds to the concept.
        - Example: If the concept is a car, describe the "glossy yellow paint job on the new 2017 LMP2 machine."
     2. **Obscure Descriptors**:
        - Choose and write a list of three obscure descriptors that will guide the AI in generating features, gestures, views, and positioning.
        - Example: "Art Nouveau, ethereal glow, biomorphic shapes."
     3. **Mood and Artistic Flair**:
        - Create a rare descriptive mood that will guide the lighting choice and color palette, adding a special flair to the concept in the chosen medium.
        - Example: "A melancholic and nostalgic mood with a touch of surrealism."
     4. **Artistic Style and Perspective**:
        - Choose an overall style that ties the guide together, guiding your choice of perspective, tool, composition, and effects.
        - Example: "Cubist style with a worm's eye view."
     5. **Flair Element**:
        - Add a flair element such as a period of time, a specific tool, a technique, or a cross-domain methodology.
        - Example: "1920s Art Deco period, with a fan brush technique."
     6. **Lighting and Color Palette**:
        - Determine the lighting and color palette to enhance the scene.
        - Example: "Soft, diffused lighting with a pastel color palette."
     7. **Tool and Artistic Effects**:
        - Select the tool and effects to use, ensuring they enhance the visual narrative.
        - Example: "Nikon D7500 camera with a tilt-shift effect."
     8. **Storytelling Element**:
        - Provide a brief narrative or background that gives context to the concept. This can include historical, cultural, or fictional elements that enhance the visual story.
        - Example: "In a post-apocalyptic world where nature reclaims the ruins of civilization, the lone survivor..."

2. **Create Unique and Evocative Combinations**:
   - **Obscurity and Uniqueness**: Start with obscure styles from the aesthetic list (e.g., cottage-core) and make each successive attempt even more unique, obscure, or daring than the previous. Aim for interesting and evocative combinations.

3. **Compile into JSON Format**:
   - **Structure**: Gather the aspect, physical trait, obscure descriptors, mood, artistic flair, artistic style, perspective, lighting choice, color palette, tool, and effects as a string titled `artistic_guide`.
   - **Format**: Return the list of artistic guides in the following JSON format:

```json

  "artistic_guides": [

    {{"artistic_guide": "Artistic Guide 2 as text"}},
