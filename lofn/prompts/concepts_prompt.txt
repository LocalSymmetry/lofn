**INSTRUCTIONS**: Be intentional but detailed when describing art. Write lists over writing explanations. Follow the Concept and Mediums Guide.

Let's make our first 12 attempts at a concept. Follow these steps to come up with 12 concepts, each a phrase that encapsulates the essence of the story, the scene, and the user's idea.

1. **Diverse Interpretations and Facts**:
   1.1 **List Different Interpretations**: Identify 7 different ways to interpret the user's idea and essence.
       - Action: Write down each interpretation as a brief statement.
   1.2 **Historic Facts**: Find 6 historical facts most related to the user's idea and essence.
       - Action: Write each fact as a short sentence.
   1.3 **Obscure Facts**: Gather 8 obscure facts about the user's idea and essence that might help create a winning concept.
       - Action: List these facts concisely.
   1.4 **Mind Mapping**:
       - Action 1: Start with a central idea in the middle of a text document.
       - Action 2: Create branches from the central idea, each representing a different interpretation or fact using bullet points or nested lists.
       - Action 3: Add sub-branches with related keywords, phrases, or descriptions that expand on these ideas.
       - Action 4: Use different indentations or symbols to distinguish levels and connections.
   1.5 **SWOT Analysis**:
       - Action 1: Create a four-section list with headings: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
       - Action 2: Populate each section with relevant points about the user's idea.
   1.6 **Five Whys**:
       - Action 1: Write down the central idea or problem.
       - Action 2: Ask "Why?" five times, writing down the answer each time to delve deeper into the root cause or motivation.
   1.7 **Role Reversal**:
       - Action 1: Identify the primary perspective of the idea.
       - Action 2: Write down how the idea would be perceived from an entirely opposite perspective (e.g., if the main idea is from a hero's viewpoint, reverse it to the villain's viewpoint).

2. **Select Relevant Aesthetics**:
   2.1 **Aesthetic Selection**: Choose the top 12 most relevant aesthetics from the aesthetic list that align with the user's idea and essence.
       - Action: Write down the names of these aesthetics.
   2.2 **Rapid Ideation**: Perform rapid ideation to create 12 creative scenes based solely on the selected aesthetics.
       - Action 1: Write one sentence describing a scene for each chosen aesthetic.
       - Action 2: Ensure each scene is unique and leverages the aesthetic's distinct qualities.

3. **Evaluation and Scoring**:
   3.1 **Judge the Ideas**: Imagine being a judge in a competition with hundreds of applicants.
       - Action 1: Evaluate each interpretation, historical fact, obscure fact, and creative scene on a scale of 1 to 10.
       - Action 2: Consider their potential to create compelling and unique art pieces.
   3.2 **Starbursting**:
       - Action 1: Create a list with headings: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?
       - Action 2: Write answers to each question to explore the idea in depth and uncover new angles.

4. **Brainstorm Unique Concepts**:
   4.1 **Initial Brainstorming**: Using the top 10 facts and interpretations from step 3, brainstorm 12 unique and relevant concepts.
       - Action 1: Write each concept as a concise phrase.
       - Action 2: Start with safe interpretations and gradually move to more daring and non-obvious ideas.
   4.2 **Diversity of Ideas**: Use techniques like SCAMPER and Random Input Association.
       - Action 1: Apply SCAMPER to modify existing ideas.
       - Action 2: Introduce random words or objects and see how they connect with the ideas to spark creativity.
   4.3 **Brainwriting**:
       - Action 1: Write down ideas individually in a text document.
       - Action 2: Pass the document to another entity or process for additional input and refinement.

5. **Document and Refine**:
   - **JSON Format**: Provide your response in the following JSON format, without additional formatting or explanations outside the JSON structure:
   
```json
