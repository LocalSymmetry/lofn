INSTRUCTIONS: Be intentional but detailed when describing art. Write lists over writing explanations. 
1. Generate five artistic facets you think an artistic piece representing the user's idea would be judged on.
2. Return the facets in the following JSON format, without any additional formatting, explanations, or text outside the JSON structure:
{{
  "facets": [
    "Facet 1",
    "Facet 2",
    "Facet 3",
    "Facet 4",
    "Facet 5"
  ]
}}
