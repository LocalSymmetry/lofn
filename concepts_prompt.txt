       - Action 2: Write answers to each question to explore the idea in depth and uncover new angles.

4. **Brainstorm Unique Concepts**:
   4.1 **Initial Brainstorming**: Using the top 10 facts and interpretations from step 3, brainstorm 12 unique and relevant concepts using proper nouns and precise adjectives.
       - Action 1: Write each concept as a concise phrase.
       - Action 2: Start with safe interpretations and gradually move to more daring and non-obvious ideas.
   4.2 **Diversity of Ideas**: Use techniques like SCAMPER and Random Input Association.
       - Action 1: Apply SCAMPER to modify existing ideas.
